L is initialized with elements [10, 20, 30, 40, 3.4] using Arrays.asList().
M is created by cloning L. It contains the same elements as L, but is a different object in memory.
N is another LinkedList initialized with the same elements as L, but like M, it is also a different object in memory.



L.equals(M) and L.equals(N) return true because the equals() method compares the contents of the lists, and both M and N have the same elements as L.
L == M and L == N return false because == compares object references, and M and N are different objects from L.



L.add(111); adds 111 to the end of the list.
L.add(3, 333); inserts 333 at index 3, shifting subsequent elements to the right.
L.addFirst(9999); adds 9999 to the beginning of the list.
L.addLast(8888); adds 8888 to the end of the list.

L.poll() removes and returns the first element of the list, which is 9999.
After polling, the list no longer contains 9999.

LinkedList Operations: The code shows various operations like cloning, equality checks, iterating, adding elements, and polling elements in a LinkedList.
Key Points:
Cloning creates a new LinkedList object with the same elements.
equals() compares contents, while == compares object references.
Adding elements can be done at specific positions, the beginning, or the end.
Polling removes and returns the first element from the LinkedList.
